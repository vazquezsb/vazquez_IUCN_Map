# Range Map of the Aye-Aye: Within and outside of protected area in Madagascar
An interactive web map detailing the distribution of the Aye-Aye (_Daubentonia madagascariensis_), an endangered lemur species endemic to Madagascar. 
Protected area is outlined by polygons for reference and comparison to the distribution of this lemur species. This map uses the Javascript library leaflet.ajax, chroma.js, and fontawesome. 
The Aye-Aye was once widely distributed, but is now confined mostly to a strip of eastern rainforest. This map shows us that the Aye-Aye territory overlaps with much of the countrie's protected area. Due to threatening factors, living in protected area in no way guarantees saftey or ideal habitat for species that live there- but it is a start.
